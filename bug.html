  <div id="myDiv">
    This is some text.
  </div>
  <script>
    // Incorrectly using innerHTML to append content
    document.getElementById("myDiv").innerHTML += "<p>This is a new paragraph.</p><p>Another one.</p>"; 
    //The bug is that each time the function is called it adds the new content and appends it to the previous one
    //This can lead to unexpected behavior and issues when dealing with the DOM
