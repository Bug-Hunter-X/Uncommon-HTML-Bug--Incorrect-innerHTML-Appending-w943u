# Uncommon HTML Bug: Incorrect innerHTML Appending

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to the usage of `innerHTML` in HTML.  Incorrectly using `innerHTML` to append content repeatedly can lead to unexpected behavior and issues with managing the Document Object Model (DOM).

## Bug Description
The bug arises from appending new content to the existing `innerHTML` of an element using the `+=` operator. This method can cause the unintentional accumulation of elements, leading to unexpected layout and behavior.  A more reliable and robust approach is required.

## Solution
The provided solution showcases a better approach. Instead of appending, it completely replaces the `innerHTML` with the updated content. This ensures that the DOM reflects the intended state and avoids unintended side effects.

## How to reproduce the bug
1. Open bug.html in a web browser.
2. Observe the duplicated paragraph content.

## How to fix the bug
1. Replace bug.html with bugSolution.html
2. Observe that the content is correctly rendered without duplication.
